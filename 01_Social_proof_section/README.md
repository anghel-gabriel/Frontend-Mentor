## What I Did

1. Coded the HTML page, than added the content inside it.
2. Created the CSS file and linked it to the HTML document.
3. Coded the CSS following the "Mobile-First" rule, using media query.
4. Coded the CSS for desktop displays.

\*Mention: I used Figma.

## What Will Be Next

1. I will study more about CSS and I'll make my containers grow and shrink.
2. I will simplify the HTML document, because I noticed I nested block-level elements inside divs and. Also, I believe can use "display: block" to simplify the HTML.
3. I will study about SASS and convert my Vanilla CSS into SASS.
